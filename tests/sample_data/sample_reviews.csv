A2SUAM1J3GNN3B,0000013714,J. McDonald,"[0, 0]",I bought this for my husband who plays the piano. I got this because it was marked as compatible with his Yamaha piano and it was. The price was nice and the ordering was easy. Something to note is that this is a cable that will work with any standard electric piano. I found this out by plugging it into several electric pianos. So if you are looking for a cable to connect your electric piano to your computer then this should work for you.,5,Works with Yamaha piano,1393545600,01 28 2014
